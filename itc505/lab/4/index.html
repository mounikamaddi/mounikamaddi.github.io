                    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
                    <p><strong>Objective</strong> To investigate whether pre-eclampsia is more
                        common in first pregnancies solely because fewer
                        affected women, who presumably have a higher risk of
                        recurrence, go on to have subsequent pregnancies.<br>
                        <strong>Design</strong> Prospective cohort study.<br>
                        <strong>Setting</strong> Swedish Medical Birth Register.<br>
                        <strong>Participants</strong> 763 795 primiparous mothers who had their
                        first births in Sweden, 1987-2004.<br>
                        <strong>Main outcome measures</strong> Pre-eclampsia.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Should we rename the diabetes insipidus conditions?</h2>
                    <p><strong>Results</strong> The risk of pre-eclampsia was 4.1% in the first
                        pregnancy and 1.7% in later pregnancies overall.
                        However, the risk was 14.7% in the second pregnancy for
                        women who had had pre-eclampsia in their first pregnancy
                        and 31.9% for women who had had pre-eclampsia in the
                        previous two pregnancies. The risk for multiparous women
                        without a history of pre-eclampsia was around 1%. The
                        incidence of pre-eclampsia associated with delivery
                        before 34 weeks’ gestation was 0.42% in primiparous
                        women, 0.11% in multiparous women without a history of
                        pre-eclampsia, and 6.8% and 12.5% in women who had
                        had one or two previous pregnancies affected,
                        respectively. The proportion of women who went on to
                        have a further pregnancy was 4-5% lower after having a
                        pregnancy with any pre-eclampsia but over 10% lower if
                        pre-eclampsia was associated with very preterm delivery.
                        The estimated risk of pre-eclampsia in parous women did
                        not change with standardisation for pregnancy rates.<br>
                        <strong>Conclusions</strong> Having pre-eclampsia in one pregnancy is a
                        poor predictor of subsequent pregnancy but a strong
                        predictor for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in future
                        gestations. The lower overall risk of pre-eclampsia among
                        parous women was not explained by fewer conceptions
                        among women who had had pre-eclampsia in a previous
                        gestation. Early onset pre-eclampsia might be associated
                        with a reduced likelihood of a future pregnancy and with
                        more recurrences than late onset pre-eclampsia when
                        there are further pregnancies. Findings are consistent
                        with the existence of two distinct conditions: a severe
                        recurrent early onset type affected by chronic factors,
                        genetic or environmental, and a milder sporadic form
                        affected by transient factors.

                    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                        <p>Pre eclampsia has been defined as a disease of first
                        pregnancies.1 The association between primiparity 
                        and pre-eclampsia is so widely accepted that it is at
                        the core of several pathophysiological theories. For
                        example, it has been proposed that pre-eclampsia is
                        the consequence of a maternal immune reaction
                        against paternal antigens expressed in the placenta
                        and that this reaction might result in defective 
                        trophoblast invasion and subsequent placental dysfunction.
                        The lower risk of pre-eclampsia among multiparous
                        women has been attributed to desensitisation after
                        exposure to paternal antigens in the placenta during
                        previous pregnancies. The lower risk has also been
                        attributed to smoother trophoblastic invasion after
                        modification of maternal spiral arteries during the first
                        pregnancy.

                        <p>We hypothesised that pre-eclampsia is more common in first pregnancies because women 
                        who experience pre-eclampsia during their first pregnancy, whom
                        might have an increased risk for genetic or environmental reasons, 
                        might decide not to take further risks
                        and have no more pregnancies. In addition, subfecundity has been 
                        associated with a higher risk of preeclampsia. 
                        Thus an underlying disorder might result
                        in both pre-eclampsia in the first pregnancy and subsequent infertility.</p>
                        Most previous studies included relatively small
                        cohorts of pregnancies without prospective follow-up
                        of women from the beginning of their reproductive
                        history.1 5 We used a large population based cohort to
                        investigate the association between parity and the risk
                        of pre-eclampsia, before and after adjustment for
                        potential selection bias.
                        
                    <p><h2>METHODS</h2>
                        Study population
                        The Swedish Medical Birth Register is a population
                        based registry that includes more than 98% of all births
                        in Sweden.6 Starting with the first antenatal visit, nomally at 8-12 weeks’ gestation, 
                        information is prospectively collected on maternal demographic data,
                        reproductive history, pregnancy, and birth characteristics. Such information 
                        is recorded on the standardised antenatal, obstetric, and neonatal records, and
                        copies of these records are forwarded to the birth register, where the information 
                        is computerised. The current study included only women who had their first
                        delivery on or after 1 January 1987, with reproductive.

                    <h2>Impact of confounders</h2>
                    <p>
                        After having a first pregnancy with pre-eclampsia, the
                        adjusted odds ratio for having another pregnancy was
                        0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.94) compared
                        with women without pre-eclampsia in their first pregnancy. 
                        This adjusted odds ratio was closer to the null
                        than the crude odds ratio (0.84, 0.82 to 0.86), 
                        suggesting that the observed association between 
                        pre-eclampsia and the likelihood of subsequent pregnancies was
                        partially explained by measured confounders
                    </p>
                    <!--left content-->
                    <p>
                        The results were similar when we limited our analysis
                        to women with a singleton birth in the first pregnancy
                        (data not shown). Among the 12 756 (1.7%) women
                        who had twins (or more) during their first pregnancy,
                        12.3% developed pre-eclampsia during that pregnancy. 
                        During the second pregnancy, the risk was
                        6.3% for women who had developed pre-eclampsia in
                        their first pregnancy and 1.1% for those who had not.
                        The proportion of women with a second pregnancy
                        was 25.4% after having a first twin pregnancy with
                        pre-eclampsia and 26.4% after a twin pregnancy without pre-eclampsia.

                        <strong>Impact of temporal trends</strong>
                        The risk of pre-eclampsia during first pregnancy was
                        3.2% in 1987-9, 4.0% in 1990-4, 4.8% in 1995-9, and
                        4.2% in 2000-4. Among women without pre-eclampsia
                        in the first pregnancy, the proportion with a subsequent 
                        pregnancy by the end of follow-up was 83.5%
                        in 1987-9, 80.5% in 1990-4, 73.8% in 1995-9, and
                        31.0% in 2000-4. (Note the increasingly incomplete follow-up of 
                        women’s reproductive life over study years.)
                        The proportion of subsequent pregnancy among
                        women with pre-eclampsia in first pregnancy was 3%
                        to 5% lower within each time period.

                        <strong>Impact of outcome definition</strong>
                        Ten percent of primiparous women with pre-eclampsia delivered before 34 weeks of gestation. The risk of
                        such severe pre-eclampsia was 0.42% in the first pregnancy and 0.14% in later pregnancies (fig 3). Among
                        women who had developed severe pre-eclampsia in
                        their first pregnancy, the risk of any pre-eclampsia
                        was 29% in their second pregnancy; and the risk of
                        severe pre-eclampsia was 62 times higher (6.8%) than
                        in women without pre-eclampsia in their first pregnancy (0.11%). During the third pregnancy, the risk
                        of severe pre-eclampsia was 12.5% for women who
                        had developed this condition in the previous two pregnancies and 0.13% for those without a history of severe
                        pre-eclampsia
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The proportion of women having a second pregnancy was 11% lower after a first pregnancy with
                        severe pre-eclampsia than in women without this condition in their first pregnancy; the proportion of
                        women with three or more pregnancies ranged from
                        13.5% to 29.2%, depending on history. Despite this
                        apparent selection of lower risk women, the estimated
                        incidence of severe pre-eclampsia among multiparous
                        women would have been just 0.15% (rather than
                        0.14%) if women with and without severe pre-eclampsia in their first pregnancy had the same likelihood of
                        another pregnancy. After having a first pregnancy with
                        severe pre-eclampsia, the adjusted odds ratio of a subsequent pregnancy was 0.69 (0.64 to 0.75) compared
                        with women without the condition in their first pregnancy, which was closer to the null than the crude odds
                        ratio (0.63, 0.59 to 0.68).

                    <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this large prospective cohort study, the incidence of
                        pre-eclampsia was 4.1% in primiparous women and
                        1.7% in parous women in Sweden between 1987 and
                        2004. The increased risk of pre-eclampsia in primiparous compared 
                        with multiparous women was not
                        explained by a biological or self selection of low risk
                        women throughout gestations. So, is pre-eclampsia
                        really a disease of primiparous women? It depends
                        on the history. For multiparous women, the risk was
                        significantly different for women who had pre-eclampsia in one (around 15%) 
                        or two (around 30%) consecutive previous pregnancies than for those with
                        no history (around 1%). Although a longer interval
                        between first and second pregnancies was associated
                        with a higher incidence of pre-eclampsia, the risk for
                        women without pre-eclampsia during their first pregnancy remained substantially 
                        lower even after eight
                        years (2.2%), compared with women with pre-eclampsia in their first pregnancy.
                    </p>
                    <p> Multiple gestations
                        Multiple gestations were associated with an increased
                        risk of pre-eclampsia (12%) and with a lower recurrence of pregnancy. Yet, multiple gestations did not
                        explain the association between primiparity and preeclampsia. Interestingly, the proportion of women
                        with subsequent pregnancies after having twins or triplets was similar to that after two singleton births. This
                        observation is compatible with families having a target
                        number of children, as well as with a higher incidence
                        of multiple gestations in subfertile couples undergoing
                        infertility treatments. It is also worth noting that the
                        recurrence of pre-eclampsia when the first affected
                        pregnancy was a multiple gestation was half of that
                        found when it was a singleton pregnancy. This finding
                        suggests that a proportion of pre-eclampsias in multiple gestations might be caused by the fetal multiplicity
                        itself, rather than to underlying constant maternal risk
                        factors

                        Having pre-eclampsia in one pregnancy is a poor predictor for subsequent pregnancy but a strong predictor
                        for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in future gestations.
                        Contrary to what we had hypothesised, the lower overall risk of pre-eclampsia among parous women was not
                        explained by fewer conceptions among women who
                        experienced pre-eclampsia in a previous gestation.
                        Early onset pre-eclampsia was associated with more
                        recurrence of pre-eclampsia and fewer subsequent
                        pregnancies than late onset events. Findings are consistent with the existence of two distinct conditions: a
                        severe early onset type affected by chronic factors,
                        genetic or environmental, and a milder sporadic type
                        affected by transient factors.

                <h2>Addendum</h2>
                <p>
                    In crafting the design for this document, a series of specific decisions were made to ensure readability, accessibility, and an elegant visual appeal.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Font Choices</h3>
                <p>
                    I predominantly used the classic '<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Times New Roman</span>' for the body text because of its readability and professional look. However, for certain headers, '<span style="font-family: 'Calibri';">Calibri</span>' was used for its modern appearance and clean lines.
                </p>

                <h3>Font Sizes</h3>
                <p>
                    The main headings, denoted as <code>h1</code>, are set to <code>2.2em</code>, striking enough to draw attention and denote a topic shift. Subheadings, <code>h2</code>, are slightly smaller at <code>1.8em</code> and feature a muted color for a subtle hierarchy. The primary text size remains at a comfortable <code>1em</code>, promoting ease of reading.
                </p>

                <h3>Margin & Padding Choices</h3>
                <p>
                    For an airy feel and organized layout, a body margin of <code>2em</code> on the sides was established, while sections received a generous <code>20px</code> padding. Headings have top margins eliminated to cling closely to their subsequent content, but a bottom margin was retained to separate them from following sections. This, coupled with the indentation for each paragraph, ensures a natural flow of the content.
                </p>

                <h3>Additional Styling Choices</h3>
            <p>
                The two-column layout maximizes space utilization, enabled by the flexible box (flexbox) model. Each column was padded with <code>10px</code> to ensure content doesn't touch the edges. Shadows and background colors were used to elevate sections and headers, giving the design depth and dimension. Notably, each link transitions smoothly to its hover state, adding an interactive element to the design.
            </p>
            
             </div>
        <div class="column">
            
            <h3>Color Choices</h3>
            The following are the color choices used in the document:
            <p>
                A base color of <code>#333</code> (a deep gray) was used for body text to be softer on the eyes than a stark black. Links were rendered in <code>#007BFF</code>, a bright blue, for easy identification with a hover effect deepening the shade to <code>#0056b3</code>. Notably, the section representing 'research' is showcased in dark blue, with white text for maximum contrast. The BMJ title was specially rendered in a serene shade of blue, <code>#0099cc</code>, providing a visual anchor for the entire page.
            </p>
                <p>These colors were chosen to ensure readability, provide a modern look, and maintain a neutral and non-distracting appearance for a text-heavy page.</p>
           
            

                
                    <h2>HTML Abuse</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the process of styling and formatting this document, there were certain instances where standard HTML practices were not strictly adhered to, primarily for stylistic reasons. Below is an explanation of these deviations:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Title Heading:</strong> The title of the essay was originally marked up with an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag due to its visually appealing font size. However, since the title represents the highest-level heading on the page, it has been correctly changed to an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag for semantic correctness.
                        </li>
                        <!-- You can add more points here if you had other deviations -->
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It's essential to note that while such deviations were made for visual reasons, semantic correctness and accessibility are critical. Future iterations of this document will aim to align more closely with standard HTML practices while maintaining the desired visual appeal.
